# Unity NPC-Automatic Dialogue System 2.5D

The NPC-Automatic  Dialogue System is a 2.5D Automatic Dialogue System inspired by Hollow Knight. This tool allows you to  implement dialogues within your Unity game like Hollow Knight, complete with customizable NPC names, sentences, audio clips, and texts.
-  You can download the Unity Package and add it into your Project on Itch.io: (https://itchiovp.itch.io/25d-unity-3d-free-to-use-dialogue-system)
## How it Works
- When the player approaches an NPC, a text prompt appears, indicating the option to listen. By pressing the W key, the conversation starts automatically and rotates the player to face the NPC. The NPC Dialogue is displayed gradually displaying each sentence or paragraphy the Unity User writes. Each sentence goes hand to hand with an audio the user can add to make the game more alive at the start of every sentence. The animated text happens inside the script automatically. The user can change the font of the text,the NPC name,the audio and the sentences themselves. It's a handy tool that makes adding NPC dialogue to  projects easily.
